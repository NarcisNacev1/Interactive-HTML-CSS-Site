## HTML/CSS Site on MF DOOM

I've made sites like these before, but I wanted this one to be special. For my project, I only needed to create 3-4 interactive pages, so I used only HTML and CSS since we hadn't learned JavaScript yet. I'm pleased with how it turned out.

### What I Learned

- **HTML/CSS Site:** I learned how to:
  - Embed videos into the site.
  - Use Adobe Dreamweaver effectively.
  - Understand and implement CSS to create interactive menus and effects, such as making buttons flash red when hovered over.
  - Navigate and apply HTML and CSS, making it easy to create engaging web pages.
